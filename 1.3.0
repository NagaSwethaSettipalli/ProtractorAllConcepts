# Cucumber-js

This is the last version in the cucumber series. New releases will henceforth
be made under the @cucumber/cucumber package name.

By installing this version you are implicitly installing the new @cucumber/cucumber
package.

You should npm uninstall cucumber and then npm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber.

After doing this you should replace your require or import statements to load
@cucumber/cucumber instead of cucumber.

If you are using TypeScript, npm uninstall @types/cucumber (v7 has types built-in). Also
replace TableDefinition with DataTable if you are using these in your code.
